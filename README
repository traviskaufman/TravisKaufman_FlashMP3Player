*********AUDIO FOR THE WEB: FLASH MP3 PLAYER*******
*********by Travis Kaufman*************************
===================================================

This simple MP3 player was designed using Flash 
Builder 4.5, and is my Audio for the Web assignment.
It is also my first endeavor with the Flash platform.

Although this program is relatively simple, I tried to
make it as scalable as possible and I also gave it my 
best shot with design/interface formatting. 

If you'd like you can literally zip up this folder and
import it directly into Flash Builder 4.5+ and it should 
be ready to be edited improved. However, also feel free
to peruse my current implementations/code under the src/
folder. Thank you and enjoy!
